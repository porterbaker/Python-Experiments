# Python-Experiment

This repository contains the initial code I've created and my journey with Github as I take DSCI 8133, *Foundations of Applied Data Science* at Mississippi State University. I'm excited for my journey towards a long and meaningful career as a Data Scientist!

## Plan

Future plans for this repository include adding a sample data file and a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook that will interact with said data file.
